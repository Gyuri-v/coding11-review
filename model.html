            <p>
                “Food” has always been the best medium for sharing
                “culture.”
            </p>
            <p>
                And this “culture” can be as simple as your mom’s old recipe
                passed on since your great great great grandparents, or as
                big as one nation’s traditional food that represents their
                rich history and collective value.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sharing “food” means introducing a new culture; a truly
                unique experience for each and every person. For some, it
                would be a familiar everyday dish, but for others it's a
                whole new culinary experience. (Just like how Kimchi means
                different things to different people)
